To view the whole code for the warehouse mapping please view this link: https://nbviewer.org/github/AndrewNassar/Ind708/blob/main/Omar%27s%20Code/IND708_MAPPING_CODE.ipynb


We used a python library called folium to create the mapping. For some reason folium and github do not mix well toghther. Theres a website called nbviewer that fixes this problem. You'll be able to view the whole code with the outputs there.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to email us and ask us anything!
